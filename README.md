# Password Genie

## Description
Since I never know what password to have for my different accounts, I thought why not make a password generator. That way I have a different password instead of using the same one all the time. This greatly reduces the risk of others guessing your password and getting access to sensitive data. 



## Credits
-Received help from TA's 
-Stack Overflow was also of great assistance



## Features

The only feature it has is the button. Once you click the button prompts will appear for your criteria in a password and then the password should be generated ideally.
